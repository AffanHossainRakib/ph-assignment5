### 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
   getElementById is used to select a single element by its unique id and always returns either one element or null if not found.In contrast, getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a specific class name and returns a live HTMLCollection, meaning it updates automatically if the DOM changes. On the other hand, querySelector and querySelectorAll are more flexible because they accept any valid CSS selector. querySelector returns only the first matching element, while querySelectorAll returns a static NodeList of all matching elements, which does not update automatically with DOM changes. In short, getElementById is best for unique IDs, getElementsByClassName is for multiple elements of the same class, and querySelector/querySelectorAll are preferred when using complex CSS-style selectors.

### 2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
   To create and insert a new element into the DOM, we first use document.createElement() to generate the element, then set its content or attributes, and finally insert it into the desired position within the document. For example, if we want to add a new paragraph, we can create it with document.createElement("p"), assign text using the textContent property, and then insert it into a parent element with methods like appendChild(), append(), prepend(), or insertBefore(). Using appendChild() will place the new element at the end of the parent, while prepend() adds it at the beginning, and insertBefore() allows inserting before a specific existing child. This approach ensures that elements are created dynamically and placed exactly where you want them in the DOM structure.

### 3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
   Event bubbling is the process in which an event triggered on a child element propagates upward through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the root (document). For example, if we click a button inside a div, the click event first fires on the button itself, then bubbles up to the div, then to the body, and eventually to the document. This behavior allows parent elements to listen for events happening on their child elements without attaching separate event listeners to each child. By default, most events in JavaScript use bubbling, but we, developers can control it using methods like event.stopPropagation() to prevent the event from moving further up, or by using event capturing (the opposite phase) if needed. This mechanism makes event handling more efficient and flexible in complex DOM structures.

### 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
   Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique where instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements individually, we attach a single event listener to a common parent element and use event bubbling to handle events on its children. When an event occurs on a child, it bubbles up to the parent, and the parent’s event listener can identify the actual target using event.target. This approach is useful because it improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners in the DOM, makes the code cleaner, and is especially handy when dealing with dynamically created elements, since you don’t need to reattach listeners every time a new child element is added.

### 5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
   The preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods in JavaScript serve different purposes when handling events. The preventDefault() method stops the browser’s default behavior associated with an event, such as preventing a form from submitting, stopping a link from navigating, or disabling right-click context menus. On the other hand, stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up or propagating to parent elements in the DOM hierarchy, meaning only the target element’s event handler will run. In short, preventDefault() controls the default action of the browser, while stopPropagation() controls the flow of the event through the DOM.
